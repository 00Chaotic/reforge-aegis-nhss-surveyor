# WORK-IN-PROGRESS, IS NOT READY YET

# reforge-aegis-nhss-surveyor
A simple [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) plugin to aid the ReForge Aegis Coalition's NHSS surveys. This plugin reads the journal for NHSS discovery events and uses the data to update the spreadsheet (TODO: link to be added).

# Installation
Like other EDMC plugins, simply download the `.zip` archive from the releases section (TODO: link to be added) and place it in the plugins folder. For more info, see the [EDMC plugins page](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector/wiki/Plugins).

# Usage
After installing the plugin, simply head to your target system and start scanning via FSS. The plugin will automatically update the spreadsheet.

**NOTE:** The player journal only logs the NHSS events if scanned through the FSS, so **scanning the nav beacon will not work**.
